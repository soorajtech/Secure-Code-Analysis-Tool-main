---

## 🚀 Features

* Upload interface for Python files
* Simulated code quality and security scan
* Placeholder scan results
* Fully responsive design
* No backend — frontend-only mockup

## 🔍 How It Works

This frontend demo simulates a secure code analysis tool:

* A user uploads a `.py` file
* Clicking "Scan" shows mock results
* Meant for UI testing and future backend integration

Planned backend tools:

* `Pylint` for code quality checks
* `Bandit` for security vulnerability scanning
